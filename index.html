    <h1 class="wifilan">Wifi lan</h1>
    <p>
        LAN is available in every room of all Hostels. Students have to bring their 
        own LAN cable to connect it to their Laptop/PC. And Wi-Fi is available in 
        Academic Section, In Library and many more place.


    </p>
    <p>
        For to connect to wi-fi you just have to select iitmwifi in wi-fi option on your
        device and connect it through your roll no and LDAP Password. 
    </p>
    <p>General Instruction to connect LAN :</p>
    <p>
        Firstly we have to do Remote Proxy setup, If you require access to 
       workflow.iitm.ac.in, academic.iitm.ac.in or other internal websites OR
       journals available through IITM subscription other restricted websites available only through IITM network 
       and do not
        otherwise need access to licenses or servers inside IIT Madras, please use
        the following proxy setup instead of VPN. Instructions are given here for
        Firefox only - for Chrome or Internet Explorer/Edge, you will need to see how
        to set up the proxy options. Also, the instructions here are only for desktop,
        so please give feedback if you know how to make it work for mobile
        browsers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Step 1: Open the “Preferences” page in Firefox <br>
            Step 2: Open the “Network Settings” page under the Preferences (search for
            “proxy” should do it)<br>
            Step 3 :Set the Proxy Auto-Config URL and reload if necessary<br>
            Step 4 :Log in with LDAP credentials (not ADS).<br>
            Effect <br>
            Once the above steps are done, you should find that only traffic destined
            for workflow, academic, journals etc goes through the proxy, and everything
            else goes through your regular network. If you are still not able to access
            journals etc., send a screenshot of error message (if possible) to
            nitin@ee.iitm.ac.in.

    <h1 class="todolist">To do list</h1>
    <p>
        Freshie year is the year when you have so much enthu to explore
        and figure out insti life. You get to learn how to live an independent
        balanced life with fun and acads. Here is a checklist which you can
        have a look at to start your insti adventures.

    </p>
    <p>
        Contact your Saathi mentor<br>
        When you come to a new place, confusion and anxiety are natural.
        Saathi mentor helps you to settle down mentally. They are your
        seniors who have experience living here and they will help you with
        figuring out how insti life works. You are welcome to disturb your
        saathi mentor whenever you want :)
    </p>
    <p>
        Explore your new home<br>
        For the next few years, you will live in this place so make sure you
        know what is where. Find out where places like the shopping
        complex and important offices are. Also do all those freshie
        adventure tasks like finding out where aero-well, third elephant, and
        railway tracks are. Make sure that you attend the OAT movie nights
        and Himalaya lawn events. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Find out people<br>
        A lone life with all books surrounding is not what you should expect
        from this place. It's all about meeting new people and exploring your
        new life so don't hesitate to introduce yourself to people. Make sure
        that you know people from other departments and batches. A
        stable and reliable friend circle makes your insti life joyful and
        enjoyable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Attend the insti events<br>
        Insti is a very happening place with one or another event happening
        every day. Check your smail regularly for updates about events;
        attend as many events as possible and soon you will find out your
        areas of interest, and then you can specifically search for those
        events. It is also a good opportunity to meet new people. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Non-insti expeditions<br>
        Chennai is a happening place where you get a lot of options to
        explore. From food streets to shopping malls you are gonna cherish
        your every outing. Don't miss the trip to Mahabalipuram and
        Pondicherry(so soon?) which might be the first long journey by most
        of you without your parents. 
    </p>
    <p>
        First night-out<br>
        Have you ever stayed up and seen the morning sun, if not this is the
        chance to do that. It might be a late-night PoR meet or a rant
        session with your friends- whatever it is you are gonna enjoy that (if
        it is a day before a holiday!). End your night out with the morning sun
        at Watsa which will be the cherry on the cake.
    </p>
    <p>
        Academics<br>
        After years of jam-packed study schedules and stressful entrance
        exam days, you might tend to sit back and relax for a while. But
        remember that acads are the most important part of your insti life,
        and some extracurriculars have minimum CGPA criteria to be
        fulfilled. Make sure that you don't miss out on anything you like
        because of your low CGPA. Learn to have a balance between both.
    </p>
    <p>
        Live your life<br>
        At the end of all of these, it is to live your life to the fullest. After you
        graduate, when you turn back, you will find it a rollercoaster ride. Let
        it be a ride of highs, lows, and ups and downs, rather than confining
        yourself within your comfort zone. Welcome to the most beautiful
        years of your life. Welcome to IITM.

    <p>Ragging must be a word that is bothering you at the back of your mind. Well,
        at the outset, let us inform you that the practice of ragging is not condoned
        by the institute in any form. If you have any problems regarding this, please
        feel free to contact your SMC mentor or the hostel warden. Do not let this word
        alarm you. All you may have would be a small chat with a group of seniors,
        who would crack a joke or two, with the intention of easing the air around and
        to break the ice. This friendly conversation has always ended up in leaving
        both the parties close to each other. For the seniors it is the time to get rid of
        unwanted books. For the juniors it is an hour or two well spent getting to know
        the ropes. Nothing more, nothing less. We empathize in case you feel
        uncomfortable and are always free to let them know or leave the place. Also
        please let your mentor know if someone is not abiding by the above.
